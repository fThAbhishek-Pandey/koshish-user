      <h2>WHAT DO WE DO?</h2>
      <p>
        We read, we play, we paint, and we do experiments. Quite understandably.
        We also provide some financial help to some really needy students. Also,
        there's a library to feed the interest of the students, and provide a
        support in their studies as well. Also, the students are taught music in
        some free time. We also try to instill in them moral and social values
        like discipline, punctuality, humane values, while creating awareness
        among them about the various social problems around them. The volunteers
        also make trips to the villages, visiting the kids' homes to understand
        their problems in a better way.

              they get into it. Special classes are being conducted for the
              students of C lass 5th and 8th to prepare them well for its
