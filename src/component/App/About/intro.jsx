        True to its Hindi literal, KOSHISH, a social initiative of REC Ambedkar
        Nagar students, is mainly focused on providing education to the
        marginalized section students, at least up to the level where they too
        can dream big.
      </p>
      <p>
        In KOSHISH, we try to inspire the students to dream and enable them to
        achieve it through education with the belief that ' simple effort can
        fill colors in many lives.
