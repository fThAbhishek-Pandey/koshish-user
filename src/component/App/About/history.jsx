        When a try is given whole heartedly, it accomplishes the ultimate goal
        and then a revolution is on the verge of being started. Such kind of
        thing was a venture started by our seniors to educate the children
        belonging to the trodden society, giving them elementary knowledge.
        'KOSHISH' is a philanthropic deed in chain by our seniors and this
        legacy is brought forward by us.

        We, the students of Rajkiya Engineering College Ambedkar Nagar, educate
        and impart basic knowledge down trodden community of the village nearby
        our hostels. This act of humanity and serene mentality fills our souls
        with the eternal peace. We will keep forwarding this goal of filling
        light of education in one's life, as it counts for the development of
        our country.

        It is initiated by our seniors (2011-2012 batch) by their own
        contribution and efforts. It comes in the Council of Social Awareness
        Activities, REC Ambedkar Nagar.
